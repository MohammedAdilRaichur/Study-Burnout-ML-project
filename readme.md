# 🎓 AI Study Productivity & Burnout Predictor

  An end-to-end machine learning web application that predicts a student's
productivity score and burnout risk based on daily habits, and provides
personalized advice to improve focus and well-being.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Students often struggle with balancing study hours, sleep, and stress.
Without understanding their productivity levels and burnout risk, they
may overwork themselves, leading to poor performance and mental fatigue.


## 💡 Solution
This project uses machine learning models to:
- Predict a productivity score (regression)
- Predict burnout risk (classification)
- Provide actionable advice based on predictions and user inputs
